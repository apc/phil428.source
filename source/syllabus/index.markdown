In this course we will examine two very important and closely connected philosophical developments in the second half of the twentieth century. The first is the renewal of interest in questions about linguistic meaning and the attendant hope that answering such questions might solve most philosophical problems (if not all of them). The second is the resurgence of traditional metaphysics. Along the way, we will touch on questions about reductionism, naturalism, and its rivals. Authors will include Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gilbert Ryle, R. M. Hare, W. V. O. Quine, Saul Kripke, Donald Davidson, Paul Grice, and David Lewis.
