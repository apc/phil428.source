As stated in the [syllabus](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2015884/phil428.pdf): 

> Reading, writing, and engaging with the material in discussion are all important aspects of philosophy. As such, *attendance is mandatory*, except in the case of a legitimate documented excuse.

Keep in mind that 10% of your grade will be based on attendance and participation.
