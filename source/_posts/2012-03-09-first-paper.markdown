By now, you should each have received two sets of comments on your draft for your [first paper](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/assignments/#paper1). You should incorporate these into the final version of the paper, which should be between 5 and 7 pages long. Your grade for the final version on the paper will depend, in part, on how well you incorporate your peers feedback on your paper.
