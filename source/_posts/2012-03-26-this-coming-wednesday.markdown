For Wednesday you should read the rest of Chapter 2 of Kripke, *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*. An electronic copy is available in the usual place. 

Remember that if you are taking the class for credit, you should schedule an appointment to discuss your first paper. If you have not received an email from me with instructions on how to sign up, please let me know.
