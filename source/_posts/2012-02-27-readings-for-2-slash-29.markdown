We will finish our discussion of Grice. Read ['Further notes on Logic and Conversation'](http://aardvark.ucsd.edu/language/grice_further_notes.pdf) and come ready to work through a few more examples. A PDF of the text is also available in the Dropbox folder.

Remember that the draft of your [first paper](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/assignments/#paper1) is due on Wednesday.
