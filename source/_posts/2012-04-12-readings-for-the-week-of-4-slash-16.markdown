Next week we will start our discussion of Kripke, *Naming and Necessity*. For Monday, please read the first lecture. As I mentioned in class last Wednesday, this is one instance where you *really* should not leave the reading until the last minute. Start reading as soon as you can. 

Note that there will be reading questions due Monday, so that's another reason to do the readings in advance. The reading question will be [posted](/assignments) in the next few hours. 

One final note: please remember to fill out the Doodle poll for the make-up class.
