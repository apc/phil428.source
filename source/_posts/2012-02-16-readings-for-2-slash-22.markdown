Next week we will begin discussion of Paul Grice's ['Logic and Conversation'](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ls/studypacks/Grice-Logic.pdf). This is the second one of Grice's William James lectures, delivered at Harvard in 1967. I've posted the first and third lectures in the Dropbox folder. 

For next Wednesday, you should read the [second lecture](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ls/studypacks/Grice-Logic.pdf), as well as Chapter 9 of Soames' *Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century*, vol. 2.
