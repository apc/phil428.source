As you may have noted, we have departed from the tentative schedule on the [syllabus](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2015884/phil428.pdf). We have six weeks of class left, so we are going to have to cut a few things from the original schedule. For now, the plan is to follow something like this updated schedule:

<!-- more -->

1. Week of 3/19: Finish Chapter 2 of Word and Object; start Kripke, *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language* (exceprts). 
2. Week of 3/26: Selections from Kripke, *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*; Quine, 'Reference and Modality'. 
3. Week of 4/2: Kripke *Naming and Necessity* ([no class](/calendar) on Wednesday, 4/4).
4. Week of 4/9: Kripke, *Naming and Necessity*.
5. Week of 4/16: Kripke, *Naming and Necessity*; Lewis, *On the Plurality of Worlds*
