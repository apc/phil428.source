We will resume our discussion of Chapter 2 of *Word and Object* after Spring break. For Monday, re-read &sect;&sect;12-16. 

On Wednesday, we will start our discussion of Kripke, *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*. Start by reading the very short first chapter. I will assign selections from Chapter 2 before the end of Spring Break. 

Remember that your final draft of the [first paper](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/assignments/#paper1) is [due](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/calendar/) on Wednesday.
