If we have time, we will start discussing the Private Language Argument. This will occupy us for the rest of the week. On this, read &sect;&sect;243--259 and skim &sect;&sect;259--315 (in the Dropbox folder). You may also want to take a look at the section entitled 'The Private Language Argument' in Soames' *Philosophical Analysis*, vol. 2, pp. 44--59.
