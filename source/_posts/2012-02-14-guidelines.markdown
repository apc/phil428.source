As stated in the [syllabus](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2015884/phil428.pdf):

>All assignments must be submitted electronically. Please name the files using the following convention: `<your USC username>.<ext>`

So if your USC email address is `tomato@usc.edu` and you turn in your paper as a `.pdf`, the file you send me should simply be named: `tomato.pdf`. Only include the name of the assignment ('Paper 1', etc.) in the subject of the email. 

Please keep this in mind in the future.
