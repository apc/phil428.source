This coming week our focus will be Chapter Two of Quine's *Word and Object*. For Monday, read &sect;&sect;7-11. Read the rest of the chapter for Wednesday. A good secondary resource is Chapter 10 of Soames' *Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century*, vol. 2. 

For background reading, you can look at Quine's ['Two Dogmas of Empiricism'](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2181906).  

I've placed electronic copies of the Quine readings in the course Dropbox folder.
