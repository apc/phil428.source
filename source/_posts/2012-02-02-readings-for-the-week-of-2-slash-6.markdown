Next week we will continue our discussion of chapters 5 and 6 of Hare's *[The Language of Morals](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com.libproxy.usc.edu/view/10.1093/0198810776.001.0001/acprof-9780198810773)*, and move on to discuss chapters 7 and 8. After reading chapters 7 and 8, you may want to look at P. T. Geach, ['Ascriptivism'](http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.usc.edu/stable/2183506), *Philosophical Review*, 69(2), 1960, pp. 221-225.
