Tomorrow we will be finishing our discussion of Lecture 2 of *Naming and Necessity*. I will make some room for questions about the final paper. After that, we will start talking about Lewis. Take a look at Chapter 1 of *On the Plurality of Worlds* (available in .pdf format in the usual place). 

I still haven't received enough responses about a possible make-up class. Hopefully tomorrow we can find a time that works for all. I hope to see you all tomorrow.
