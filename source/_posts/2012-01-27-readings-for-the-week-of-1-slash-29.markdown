As I mentioned [earlier](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/blog/2012/01/25/next-week/), next week we will finish the discussion of the Private Language Argument&mdash;remember to prepare answers to the questions posted [here](http://perezcarballo.org/phil428/blog/2012/01/25/next-week/). We will then move on to talk about R. M. Hare's [*The Language of Morals*](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198810776.001.0001/acprof-9780198810773). For next week, read chapters 5 and 6. You may also want to look at chapter 6 of the Soames'.
