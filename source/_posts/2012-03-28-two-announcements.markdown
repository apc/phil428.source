(Actually, three announcements.)

First, about next week: We will finish our discussion of Chapter 2 of Kripke, *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*. We will concentrate on his objections to the dispositional account. You may want to re-read pp. 21-36. 

If time permits, we will start our discussion of Quine, 'Reference and Modality', in *From a Logical Point of View*, 2nd ed., Cambridge: HUP, 1961. An electronic copy of that paper is available in the Dropbox folder. You may also want to look at Quine, '[Notes on existence and Necessity](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2017458)', *Journal of Philosophy*, Vol. 40, No. 5, 1943, pp. 113-127, also available in the Dropbox folder.

Second, [Ray Monk](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/philosophy/about/staff/rm.page) (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton, and author of a well-known biography of Wittgenstein, [*The Duty of Genius*](http://www.amazon.com/Ludwig-Wittgenstein-The-Duty-Genius/dp/0140159959)) will be giving a talk in the Philosophy Department on Thursday, April 5. 

> Title: "How can I be a logician before I am a human being?", The Life and Work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.
> 
> Time and place: Mudd Hall 102, 2pm

It should be fun. 

Finally, remember there is [no class](/calendar) on Wednesday, April 4.
