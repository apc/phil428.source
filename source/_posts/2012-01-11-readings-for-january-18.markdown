We will continue the discussion from today. Read the *Philosophical Investigations*, <del>&sect;30-26</del> &sect;&sect;30-36. I will make this available electronically through the [Dropbox](http://db.tt/IreiS75o) folder.

In addition to this, there will be a short reading [assignment](/assignments/) due before our next meeting, corresponding to &sect;6-21. The assignment will be posted in the next day or two. 

Remember there is no class on Monday (University holiday).

UPDATE: You may also want to look at Soames' *Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century*, vol. 2, pp. 6-8.
