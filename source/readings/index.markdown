For now, I will upload electronic versions of some of the readings to a <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> folder. In order to access that folder, you need to <a href="http://db.tt/IreiS75o">setup a (free) Dropbox account</a>. Once you have done that, you should <a href="mailto:aperezca@usc.edu">email me</a> to let me know what email address you've associated with your account. This will allow me to give you access to that folder.
